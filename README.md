# Weather App


[Live link to the deployed weather App](https://gabrieltmangum.github.io/weatherApp/)

*This project was an attempt at making an app that will allow the user to look up the weather in an city in the world.  You can search for as many cities at you would like and it will add the panel to the top of the list.*

*Please enjoy playing around with the app and feel free to try testing its capabilities.*
